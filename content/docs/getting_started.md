# So you want to do some analyses, but don't know where to start

You have come to the right place!!

From a guide on how to run programs, to little tips and tricks to make your life easier, you will find it on this website.

## For brand new lab members

**If you are brand new to this lab, read this page from top to bottom.**

**If you only want to know about a specific topic**, you can search for things in the search bar at the top right hand corner, or alterntaively, you can look through each tab/section of this web site to find the right thing.

## Background readings

We want anyone who starts out to have a basic knowledge of the following topics, and we **highly recommend** you take your time reading these topics:

- Basic Software Carpentry topics (R, GIT, and BASH)
- Association analysis
- Common file formats, where to find them, and how to use them

## Where to ask for help

At first instance, **look for topics on this website**.
If you find what you are looking for: Great!! Carry on with your life.

But if you don't, don't panic -- take these steps:
1. Google your problem with relevant keywords like your program and error messages -- usually you will find something on Wikipedia or StackOverflow
1. Ask for help or ask your question(s) on the "howdoi" channel on our lab Slack channel -- someone will be able to give you some good suggestions
1. Ask the person who have done your analysis (or done something similar) before
1. If all of the above fails, work it out yourself or abandon the problem
1. If you find a solution, write up a post and add it to this website for future reference

## Who do I ask to get help with "X"

Here is an incomplete list of topics people are familiar with in our lab.
Make sure to direct **specific** questions when you are asking for help:
